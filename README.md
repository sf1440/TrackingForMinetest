Theoretical Background

Minecraft's adaptability, cost-effectiveness, and engaging gameplay have garnered interest from various individuals, leading to its application in educational settings. Minetest, an open-source counterpart to Minecraft, plays a significant role in helping individuals develop coding skills. As a sandbox game, Minetest offers a dynamic and interactive environment that enhances students' creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration skills. The game provides a customizable platform, enabling educators to design and tailor educational content such as the customization of facilities, land, and environment. This platform also addresses specific learning objectives and individual students' needs. The flexibility of Minetest is particularly advantageous when incorporating it into a wide range of subjects, including science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM), history, geography, and language arts. Its open-source nature ensures free access for all schools, eliminating financial barriers that might exist with commercial alternatives. By integrating Minetest into the classroom, educators can offer a dynamic, immersive learning experience that promotes self-directed exploration, critical thinking, and real-world applications of subject matter [1]. Consequently, teachers can effectively bridge the gap between traditional teaching methods and the rapidly evolving world of digital technologies, better-preparing students for the challenges and opportunities they will encounter in the 21st century.
The Minetest shows a significant role when it's incorporated into educational settings. Also, the proven results illustrate the Minetest exactly fostering creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration among students. Nevertheless, a significant challenge pumps up for both educators and students on the games’ dependence on Lua scripts which may lead to unfamiliarity for students to code and edit since the Lua script is ranked 30th in coding languages [2]. To tackle this issue, our team is diligently working on rewriting and developing C++ functions that can call existing Lua functions, allowing students to focus on modifying and interacting with the game through these new C++ files. As we know, C++ is a widely acknowledged programming language, iterating and modifying the game with new C++ files not only streamlines the learning process for students but also broadens the accessibility of Minetest as an educational tool. By bridging the gap between Lua and C++, our team ensures that students can effectively engage with Minetest's educational content without the necessity to invest time in learning Lua scripting. This improvement will ultimately enhance the overall learning experience and empower students to concentrate on critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration skills essential for success in the classroom and beyond.

Prior Art

Our project uses Minetest, an application that takes heavy inspiration from the massively popular game, Minecraft. Minecraft was created in 2011 and was considered a critical success since its release 12 years ago. Another game popularized around this time was Roblox, an online gaming platform where users create, share, and play games together. Other games since have learned from this model, such as Fortnite, Counter Strike: Global Offensive, Garry’s mod, etc.All of these games heavily rely upon the fact that the user base creates the content that keeps the games interesting. The idea of user-generated content is not a new one. In fact, it is at the heart of what the internet is built upon. However, games like Minecraft and Roblox have taken this concept to a new level allowing users to play their own content quickly and easily with their friends. This has led to a new generation of coders that have grown up alongside these games, creating mods, servers, maps, minigames, and plugins without realizing the gamification of the development of their respective games.
We believe Minetest is the perfect encapsulation of the spirit of these games. It is a sandbox game that not only allows for the creation of mods, maps, servers, etc. but its open-source nature allows anyone to contribute to the games development. This has led to a community of developers that take this project and promote the use of it as a teaching aid in schools and educational institutions to teaching coding [3]. If you visit the Minetest forums, you will find many Minetest-related projects looking for coders to help in the development of their respective mods or plugins or showing off their latest coding projects. This vibrant community is a testament to the power of user-generated content in gaming and the potential of open-source games like Minetest [4]. 
The University of Florida's Cacti Council has undertaken a project to remove the Lua dependencies from Minetest, an open-source game engine, with the objective of allowing the game data to be coded in other languages like Python, Java, or WASM. The initiative aims to increase accessibility for future coders to develop mods and plugins, with the team having already converted 171 out of 480 functions before joining the Minetest team, with around 65% remaining functions for both teams to separate before reworking the game data. Through analyzing the codebase and identifying areas where Lua was used, the team worked on converting Lua functions to C++ and modifying the game's engine to work with the new code, with the ultimate goal of making the Minetest API more user-friendly, bringing it closer to its objective of being utilized in classrooms.
Following in the footsteps of the previous team we found that in order to optimize the process of rewriting Minetest functions, our team will partition the work into distinct classes, each comprising one or multiple functions that interact with the Lua script functions. To guarantee the effectiveness and accuracy of the rewritten functions, our team has incorporated a three-stage process for each member to follow. The initial stage, "written," entails creating and registering Native API functions in the corresponding Lua bound C files. In the subsequent stage, "compile," team members draft chat commands for each Native API function, invoking them and ensuring they can be compiled and executed without errors or yielding nil values. The final stage, "test," concentrates on verifying the accuracy of the rewritten functions by crafting chat commands for each Native API function and comparing the outcomes with the corresponding Lua API function. Should any discrepancies emerge, the Native API function is adjusted to maintain consistency with the Lua function. This systematic based on Cacti Council’s approach enables our team to effectively rewrite and validate the new C++ functions while preserving the integrity of the original Minetest functions, ultimately improving the game's accessibility and educational value for students.
